# Welcome to the [CESM Tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html)

<br>

NCAR created the Community Climate Model (CCM) in 1983 that included a global atmosphere. In 1994, NCAR scientists started to develop the Climate System Model (CSM) that included models of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice. In order to recognize the Community of users and sponsors, the CSM was renamed to the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). With addititons, including an ice sheet and biogeochemical modeling, the model was renamed to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in 2013. 

This repository includes materials designed to be an introduction to running the CESM. The materials are used during the annual CESM tutorial and serve as reference documentation for any CESM user. 

## Goals of This Tutorial

**By the end of this online tutorial you should be able to run and modify the model and use the output.** 
**These tutorial materials are designed for the CESM version 2 (CESM2)**.

## Yearly In-Person Tutorials

The CESM tutorial has been offered regularly since 2010 and is typically offered annually during the summer. If you are interested in attending the tutorial, please see the [CESM webpage](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials) for the most up to date information about when the tutorial will next be offered in Boulder, Colorado and the timeline for applying.

## CESM Project Funding 

This material is based upon work supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Cooperative Agreement No. 1852977. Staff time on this project was also supported by the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) laboratory.

## Acknowledgements

A number of people have been critical to this effort, including:
- Alice DuVivier, Cecile Hannay, Peter Lawrence, Hui Li, Brian Dobbins, and Jesse Nusbaumer, who serve on the CESM tutorial committee and put together the tutorial materials.
- Gunter Leguy, Gustavo Marques, and Adam Phillips, who serve on the CESM tutorial committee and helped test materials.
- Elizabeth Faircloth, who supports the CESM program administratively and without whom everything would probably fall apart.
- Gokhan Danabasoglu, who supported this effort as CESM chief scientist.
- Testers, others...
