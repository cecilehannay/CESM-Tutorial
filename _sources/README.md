# Welcome to the [CESM Tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html)

<br>

This repository includes materials for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) tutorial. These materials are designed to be used during the annual CESM tutorial and serve as reference documentation for any CESM user. The materials and notebooks in this tutorial are published as a Jupyter book here to allow for searchable online documentation, but to run the actual commands presented you will need to use a terminal window. 

## Goals of This Tutorial

This tutorial is designed as an introduction to running the CESM model. **By the end of this online tutorial you should learn how to run and modify the model and use the output.** 

This tutorial includes the following topics:
* The basics of running CESM
* Simple modifications of xml files, source code, and namelists
* Some challenge exercises
* Troubleshooting
* Basic diagnostics
* Useful tools

## CESM Project Funding 

This material is based upon work supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Cooperative Agreement No. 1852977. Staff time on this project was also supported by the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) laboratory.
