    "Having successfully completed your first month of the new CESM B1850 case you will now examine the history files that have been transfered to the Archive directory. You will be using the NetCDF viewer ncview to look at the monthly average values for the single month. For this exercise you will be looking at the output from the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) component of CESM, however the ncview tool can be applied to other components such as the Community Land Model (CLM). In this exercise we will:\n",
