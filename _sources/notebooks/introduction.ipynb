    "Throughout this material, you'll need to type commands in cells in Jupyter notebooks, and run them.  This is done simply by clicking on a cell, then pressing **shift-return**, or alternatively clicking the play button up above.  Try this on the cell below, if you like - this notebook uses a **bash** kernel, so this simply runs the Linux 'echo' command to print a message:"
