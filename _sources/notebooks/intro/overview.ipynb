    "Welcome to the world of the **Community Earth System Model (CESM)**. CESM is a coupled Earth system model for simulating Earth’s climate system and connected component systems. The model is composed of separate models that simultaneously simulate the Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, land, river run-off, land-ice, and sea-ice.\n",

In 1994, NCAR scientists started to develop the Climate System Model (CSM) that included models of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice. In order to recognize the Community of users and sponsors, the CSM was renamed to the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). With addititons including an ice sheet and biogeochemical modeling, the model was renamed to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in 2013. \n",
